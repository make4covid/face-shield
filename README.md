# Make4Covid Face Shield
### Based on the [Prusa design](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc3)

This repo contains the face shield currently in production by the Make4Covid
organization. The Make4Covid design is based on [this design from Prusa](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc3).

Prusa's files were released under the CC BY-SA-NC license.

**For everyone's safety, please read and follow our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) while making PPE for use during the COVID-19 pandemic.**

### Next Steps
1. Find, read, re-read, memorize, and bookmark [the M4C SOPs](https://github.com/make4covid/sop).
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/releases) of the design files.
3. Use the SOPs to safely make the gear!

# Derivative Design Disclaimer

These designs have been tested for comfort and safety by frontline healthcare professionals. Other people and organizations are welcome to use these designs to provide PPE to anyone who needs it.

You can fork these designs and make changes under the CC license, but in doing so, you assume liability. We encourage you to use the M4C designs unless you have the resources and facilities to adequately field-test any updated components.

# Issues?
If you find a problem with a design, compatibility between files, safety, documentation, or suggestions for improvement, please [open an issue.](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=design-issue-template.md&title=)

# Github for _hardware?_
It's not unheard of. Here are some things to keep in mind.
* Diffs don't mean much on binary files, so don't worry about them.
* Github _can_ show visual diffs on `.stl` files, so it's helpful to include them in addition to other CAD file types.
* Merging is also a challenge with binaries. Replace whole files or coordinate to avoid merge conflicts.
* Hardware repos can get huge, but you don't have to clone down everything to contribute.
* If the repo gets too big, we can set up `git lfs` (large file storage) to trim it down.

If you have other ideas on how to optimize git for open-source hardware, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/make4covid/face-shield/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=design-issue-template.md&title=) to let us know!
